you may add more sports channels by adding the 'url' into the existing array by the name of "allowedUrls" (to avoid th cors blockage policy)
then , navigate to 'frontend\src\scraper\Scrape.jsx' add the same url here as one of the case in the switch case operator.
To test out the new urls, please check all the apis in the any third party app such as postman and only if it is working, commit and push!
